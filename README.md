## Tasks

- [ ] 
- [ ] Make a Ruby interpreter

## Planning

* strings? want because APIs generally use strings
* it's important to reduce the differences between platforms. by putting more core functionality in the standard library instead of the interpreter, we make an interpreter easier to write, and reduce platform differences.
* comments are hashes, to the end of the line, no multiline allowed
